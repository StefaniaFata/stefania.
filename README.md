# About me
I love staying active with hiking and fitness, exploring new recipes through cooking, and diving into a good book.📖
Recently, I’ve started learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and programming in general, and I’m really enjoying the challenge!✅
Books are a big passion of mine, but the greatest joy in my life is my son.👩‍👦
